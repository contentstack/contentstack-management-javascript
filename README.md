## Contentstack Management JavaScript SDK

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. All you have to do is build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest. [Read More](https://www.contentstack.com/).

This SDK uses the [Content Management API](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-management-api/) (CMA). The CMA is used to manage the content of your Contentstack account. This includes creating, updating, deleting, and fetching content of your account. To use the CMA, you will need to authenticate your users with a [Management Token](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/create-tokens/about-management-tokens) or an [Authtoken](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-management-api/#how-to-get-authtoken). Read more about it in [Authentication](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-management-api/#authentication).

Note: By using CMA, you can execute GET requests for fetching content. However, we strongly recommend that you always use the [Content Delivery API](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-delivery-api/) to deliver content to your web or mobile properties.

### Prerequisite

You need Node.js version 10 or above installed on your machine to use the Contentstack JavaScript CMA SDK.

### Installation
#### Node
Install it via npm:
```bash
npm i @contentstack/management
```
To import the SDK, use the following command:
```
import contentstack from ‘@contentstack/management’

contentstackClient = contentstack.client()
```

### Authentication
To use this SDK, you need to authenticate your users by using the Authtoken, credentials, or Management Token (stack-level token).
### Authtoken
An [Authtoken](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/create-tokens/types-of-tokens/#authentication-tokens-authtokens-) is a read-write token used to make authorized CMA requests, and it is a **user-specific** token.
```
contentstackClient = contentstack.client({ authtoken: 'AUTHTOKEN' })
```
### Login
To Login to Contentstack by using credentials, you can use the following lines of code:
```
contentstackClient.login({ email: 'EMAIL', password: 'PASSWORD'})
.then((response) => {
	console.log(response.notice)
	console.log(response.user)
})
```

### Management Token
[Management Tokens](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/create-tokens/about-management-tokens/) are **stack-level** tokens, with no users attached to them.
```
contentstackClient.stack({ api_key: 'API_KEY', management_token: 'MANAGEMENT_TOKEN' }).contentType('CONTENT_TYPE_UID')
.fetch()
.then((contenttype) => {
	console.log(contenttype)
})
```
### Contentstack Management JavaScript SDK: 5-minute Quickstart
#### Initializing Your SDK:
To use the JavaScript CMA SDK, you need to first initialize it. To do this, use the following code:
```
import contentstack from ‘@contentstack/management’

var contentstackClient = contentstack.client({ authtoken: 'AUTHTOKEN' })
```
#### Fetch Stack Detail
Use the following lines of code to fetch your stack detail using this SDK:
```
contentstackClient.stack({ api_key: 'API_KEY' })
.fetch()
.then((stack) => {
	console.log(stack)
})
```

#### Create Entry
To create an entry in a specific content type of a stack, use the following lines of code:
```
var  entry  = {
	title: 'Sample Entry',
	url: '/sampleEntry'
}

contentstackClient.stack({ api_key: 'API_KEY' }).contentType('CONTENT_TYPE_UID').entry().create({ entry })
.then((entry) => {
	console.log(entry)
})
```

#### Create Asset
The following lines of code can be used to upload assets to your stack:
```
var  asset  = {
	upload: 'path/to/file',
	title: 'Asset Title'
}

contentstackClient.stack({ api_key: 'API_KEY' }).asset().create({ asset })
.then((asset) => {
	console.log(asset)
})
```
